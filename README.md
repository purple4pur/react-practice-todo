This practice completes a todo list with React App. I've been learning React these days and write this todo list for practice. Two versions are included. The First is in `./Archive/src`, which I write with multi-components within `./Archive/src/components` and written by myself. In the second version in `./src` I referred to offical version placed on [React offical homepage](https://reactjs.org/), and finally finished by my own. Besides, it's the first time I use git in my project, I might also practice git skills in this repo.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br />

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
